The Scenario that this project focuses on is an affordable way to play retro video games in a modern setting.

Playing video games from a generation past is a task that isn't always simple or affordable in the modern day. Many games aren't as accessible as they were when they were initially released on their respective platforms. This is due to hardware changes and the fact that prior to the recent era that most of the current generation has experienced, games were only released physically on Discs or Cartridges. This project explains a way for fans of these kinds of games to be able to play them in an affordable manner.

A GNU/Linux system is what I believe is the best possible option for this scenario, and more specifically, RetroPie. RetroPie is a Linux Distribution based on Raspberry Pi OS and is designed for use on the single-board computer, the Raspberry Pi. In using a RPi with RetroPie installed, a user can play a variety of titles that are simple to add to the system, and currently, the Raspberry Pi 4 supports plenty of consoles including the N64, with a decent performance. Another advantage is that the low cost of the RPi makes it perfect to host the system and provide users with an easy to set up way to hop right into their old favourite games.

Another method of emulation using Linux, would be to install a lightweight Distro such as Manjaro (Which is Arch-based) onto a regular computer or a Raspberry Pi, and then installing distinct emulators onto that distribution. This way the user could install only the emulators they want, and could still use the computer for things outside of playing games.

Personally, I opted for the first option, because it maintains retro games as the primary focus, and it is overall easier to reproduce as it is way less time consuming. Also with the growing popularity of RetroPie, the distro will continue to maintain support and as Raspberry Pi models become more powerful, RetroPie will evolve with the hardware.

Options I've found outside of GNU/Linux Systems did not quite match the ease-of-access that the Linux systems have. For example, if someone wants to play titles from the N64 era, they could do so on a variety of modern consoles, but these consoles can be upwards of $200 and have a lack of support for other older consoles. They also often do not provide ALL the original titles from whatever platform is being emulated which is a problem solved by the GNU/Linux System. Otherwise the user could purchase the original console itself, but depending on the condition, it can have quite a high cost as well, not to mention the original games being very difficult to find and once again are often quite costly.
